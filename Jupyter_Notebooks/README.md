## ðŸš§ Note
All work done within three Jupyter notebooks:

  1.[EDA_and_Data_Insight](https://github.com/shhdSU/Heterogeneity_Activity_Recognizer_Using_Classification/blob/main/Jupyter_Notebooks/EDA_and_Data_Insight.ipynb)<br/>
  2. [Model_Selection](https://github.com/shhdSU/Heterogeneity_Activity_Recognizer_Using_Classification/blob/main/Jupyter_Notebooks/Model_Selection.ipynb)<br/>
  3. [Reporting_The_Final_Model](https://github.com/shhdSU/Heterogeneity_Activity_Recognizer_Using_Classification/blob/main/Jupyter_Notebooks/Reporting_The_Final_Model.ipynb)<br/>

All these notebooks depend on each other so, they should be run sequentially as they number.
